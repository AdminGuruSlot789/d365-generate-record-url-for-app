# Generate Record Url For App
Generates a Record URL specific to a Model-Driven-App for Dynamics 365.

## What is the purpose of the project?
The link generated by the out of the box using "Record URL(Dynamic)" within a workflow always links to the default app.

If the users are used to working within the Unified Interface, the default link will not open the user interface they expect.

## Prerequisites
The workflow will execute in the scope of the calling user. As such, the calling user should have read access to the App entity. 

This can be done by either of the following:
- Granting the user the "Customer service app access" security role
- Adding the Read access to the App entity to the user's security role. This is found at the top of the Customization tab.

## Solutions Included
This repo contains a managed and unmanaged solution to demonstrate the functionality of the CodeActivity.

An intentional error is thrown when running the workflow.
This is only for demonstration purposes.
