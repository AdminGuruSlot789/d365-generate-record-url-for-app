# GenerateRecordUrlForApp
Generates a Record URL specific to an App for Dynamics 365.

## What is this for?
The link generated by the out of the box "Record URL(Dynamic)" always links to the default app.
If the deployment is using the Unified Interface for a Model Driven App, this default link will not link to the intended interface.

## Prerequisites
The workflow relies on a settings entity.
The settings entity will contain the reference to the App's Id in the value field.
The App's Id can be found as the "appid" parameter when looking at a view or record in the intended App.
The settings entity can be modified to map to an existing settings entity if one already exists, otherwise, the settings entity is expected to be a simple Key Value pair combination.

### Solutions Included
